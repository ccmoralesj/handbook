# Slack Top X Channel Index

Our Slack community presents countless opportunities to learn, be inspired, get motivated, explore your passions in a variety of side quests and build friendships you'll have for many years.

Everyone in X-Team is incredibly supportive and respectful, so never fear contributing your thoughts to any channel.

And there really are plenty of channels. We have no doubt that you will find something interesting for yourself. And at the bottom of the list, you can find our custom slash-commands and some of the default slash-commands we like.

## Mentored Channels

All of these channels provide feedback on your work in their domain, resources for it, and most importantly, mentors \(see pinned post or look for someone with \[mod-something\]\), who you can schedule a 1:1 with where they help you improve directly. You can also ping a mentor squad by tagging `@[tech]-mentors` in chat. One of them is sure to respond.
